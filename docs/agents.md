# Agent Path Index

Quick reference for AI agents working on this codebase. Each entry maps a
task category to the canonical document or command that owns it.

## Multi-Agent Workflow (PI Coordinator)

Development on this fork is coordinated by a PI coding-agent session. The PI
session is the fixed coordinator: it plans, dispatches scoped tasks to
external agent CLIs through the `external-agent` plugin, reviews their
output, and commits. Which executor agent runs a given task is decided at
dispatch time — any agent the plugin supports may be used, and this document
deliberately does not prescribe one.

**Loop:** research → plan → execute → verify → review and commit.

**Principles (agent-agnostic):**

- Every dispatched task is self-contained: goal, exact files, acceptance
  criteria, return format. The executor sees none of the coordinator's
  conversation.
- Research/verification tasks run read-only. Write tasks carry a `verify`
  command (default `make test`) and never commit.
- One writer per working tree at a time; parallel write tasks need
  `isolate: true` (separate git worktree) and the coordinator merges.
- Optional task templates live in `.pi/external-agent/templates/`
  (`kumo-execute`, `kumo-verify`) — conveniences, not requirements.
- Any agent working in this repo must follow AGENTS.md, including docs sync.

## Release

**SOP:** [docs/operations/release-management.md](operations/release-management.md)

Key commands:

```bash
# Full workflow: pull → build arm64 → build amd64 → tag → release → upload manifests
make clean
make release-dmg VERSION=0.0.10       # arm64
rm -rf build/Build/Products/Release build/release/latest.yml
make release-dmg-amd64 VERSION=0.0.10  # amd64

git tag -a "0.0.10" -m "Kumo 0.0.10"
git push origin "0.0.10"

gh release create "0.0.10" --title "Kumo 0.0.10" --notes "..." \
  build/release/Kumo-macos-0.0.10-arm64.dmg \
  build/release/Kumo-macos-0.0.10-amd64.dmg

gh release upload "0.0.10" \
  build/release/latest.yml \
  build/release/latest-amd64.yml \
  --clobber
```

**Never forget:** upload `latest.yml` + `latest-amd64.yml` after creating the
release. The in-app update checker will 404 without them.

**Verify URLs:**

```bash
curl -sI "https://github.com/ProjectKumo/KumoApp/releases/latest/download/latest.yml"
curl -sI "https://github.com/ProjectKumo/KumoApp/releases/latest/download/latest-amd64.yml"
```

## Update Runtime Behavior

**Docs:** [docs/operations/app-updates/README.md](operations/app-updates/README.md)

- Feed URLs, manifest contract, polling logic, notifications, installer helper.
- `AppUpdateManager` in `Sources/KumoCoreKit/Support/AppUpdateManager.swift`.
- Architecture-aware feed suffix: arm64 → `latest.yml`, x86_64 → `latest-amd64.yml`.
