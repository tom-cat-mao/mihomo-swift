# Persistence and Logging

## Application Support Directory

Kumo stores local state under:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Kumo/
```

`KumoPaths` centralizes all paths so GUI, CLI, tests, and future service code use the same layout.

## Directory Layout

```text
Kumo/
  profiles/
    default.yaml
    profiles-metadata.json
    current.txt
  overrides/
    overrides.json
    files/
  work/
    config.yaml
  logs/
    core.log
    core-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.log
    substore.log
  cores/
    mihomo
  substore/
    status.json
    backend/
    frontend/
  state.json
  preferences.json
```

## Backup Format

Kumo can export a directory backup containing:

- `manifest.json`
- `profiles/`
- `overrides/`
- `substore/`
- `state.json`

The first backup format is directory-based rather than zip-based so it remains
transparent, testable, and easy for agents to inspect. A future UI can wrap the
same manifest in a compressed archive or sync it to WebDAV without changing the
CoreKit import/export contract.

## State File

`state.json` stores `CoreStatus`:

- core run state
- process identifier
- outbound mode
- controller endpoint
- mixed proxy port
- system proxy state (including PAC `mode` and `pacScript`)
- controlled runtime settings, including TUN stack, routing, DNS, route
  exclusions, MTU, and ICMP forwarding preferences
- last status message

This allows the CLI and GUI to share state without requiring a service in v1.
Runtime setting models must decode missing fields with defaults so app updates
can add new TUN controls without invalidating an existing `state.json`.

## User Preferences

`preferences.json` stores `UserPreferences` (UI lifecycle preferences that do
not affect Mihomo runtime):

- `launchAtLogin` — synced with `SMAppService.mainApp` by `KumoAppDelegate`.
- `hideMenuBarIcon` — persisted for the menu bar visibility preference; Kumo now uses
  an AppKit `NSStatusItem`, so runtime visibility can be wired through the status item
  controller when the Settings toggle is re-exposed.
- `quitOnLastWindowClose` — read by
  `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed`.
- `updateChannel` (`stable` / `beta`) and `updateManifestURL` — feed
  `AppUpdateManager.checkForUpdate(...)`. A blank `updateManifestURL` uses
  Kumo's default GitHub Releases feed; a value overrides it for local testing
  or private distribution.
- `appLanguage` — an optional BCP-47 language tag (e.g. `en`, `zh-Hans`).
  `nil` means follow the system language. On launch `LocalizationManager` reads
  this value and writes it to the standard `AppleLanguages` UserDefaults key so
  macOS resolves the correct `.lproj` at the next launch. The field is decoded
  with `decodeIfPresent` so older `preferences.json` files without it default to
  `nil`.

Decoding falls back to defaults so a missing or corrupted file never blocks
launch.

## App Updates

App update downloads are cached under:

```text
updates/downloads/
```

The detached DMG installer writes its log to:

```text
logs/app-update-installer.log
```

The cache is disposable. Release metadata and artifact rules are documented in
[Release Management](release-management.md).

## Sub-Store

`substore/status.json` (`SubStoreStatus`) stores enable flag, custom backend
URL, host/LAN mode, proxy mode, cron settings, resource version, copied bundle
paths, and configured ports.

Bundled Sub-Store resources are copied from `KumoCoreKit` into:

```text
substore/resources/
  manifest.json
  node/bin/node
  backend/sub-store.bundle.js
```

Sub-Store runtime data is kept under `substore/data/`, matching
`SUB_STORE_DATA_BASE_PATH`. Temporary staging work belongs under
`substore/temp/`. There is no bundled web frontend: Kumo's SwiftUI Sub-Store
surface talks to the local backend over HTTP directly.

`SubStoreSupervisor` launches the bundled Node sidecar with
`sub-store.bundle.js` and Sparkle-compatible environment variables. Stopping
Sub-Store terminates the backend process and closes the log handle.

## Runtime Configuration

The generated Mihomo runtime configuration is written to:

```text
work/config.yaml
```

Mihomo is launched with the work directory so it reads the generated config.

## Logs

Core stdout and stderr are appended to:

```text
logs/core.log
```

`CoreSupervisor.start()` rotates that file before every launch: when
`logs/core.log` exists and is non-empty, it is renamed to
`logs/core-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.log` (local time) and a fresh `core.log` is
opened for the new process. A core that is still running keeps writing to its
own rotated file, so lines from concurrent cores no longer interleave, and
`core.log` always describes the current session. Rotation is best-effort: if
the rename fails, the launch continues and the log keeps growing.

Sub-Store backend stdout and stderr are appended to:

```text
logs/substore.log
```

Each Sub-Store launch writes a header line (`[ISO timestamp] starting <executable> <args>`) so log readers can split sessions easily.

The main UI intentionally does not expose full logs on the Overview screen. Full log inspection belongs in the `Logs` destination under `Inspect`. The `Sub-Store` settings page surfaces a "View Logs" button that opens `logs/substore.log` in the user's text editor.

Live Mihomo logs should be treated as an event stream with a bounded in-memory cache. The local `core.log` file remains a fallback and diagnostic artifact.

The CLI has a separate debug-log channel under:

```text
logs/cli/
```

Each `kumo` invocation may create a `*-kumo-debug-0.log` file with command-level
diagnostics. `--logs-max <count>` controls retention, and `--logs-max=0`
disables CLI debug log files for sensitive environments. `--logs-dir <path>`
can redirect these files for temporary diagnostics.

`kumo --timing` writes a process-specific `*-kumo-timing.json` file in the same
directory. Timing files are for performance diagnostics and should not be mixed
with runtime event streams.

CLI terminal output follows npm-style log levels:

```text
silent < error < warn < notice < http < info < verbose < silly
```

Normal command results go to stdout. Logs, warnings, progress, timing summaries,
and debug-log paths go to stderr. `--json` keeps stdout as plain JSON only.

Before writing terminal or file logs, CLI diagnostics redact controller secrets,
authorization headers, basic auth passwords, subscription tokens, and token-like
query parameters. Redaction is a safety net, not a reason to paste logs into
public places without review.

## Overrides

Overrides are planned under:

```text
overrides/
  overrides.json
  files/
    <id>.yaml
    <id>.js
    <id>.log
```

YAML overrides are applied before Kumo-controlled runtime settings. JavaScript overrides require a reviewed sandbox before they are enabled.

## Future Work

- Add retention/cleanup for rotated `core-*.log` files.
- Add separate app and service logs.
- Add structured JSONL event logs for agents.
- Add privacy review for logs before sharing diagnostics.
- Add log rotation and Sub-Store log retention controls.
