# Release Management

Kumo publishes macOS app updates through GitHub Releases. Release artifacts
include a signed app DMG and a small manifest consumed by the runtime update
system.

Runtime discovery, five-minute asynchronous polling, local update
notifications, checksum verification, and installer-helper behavior are
documented in [App Updates](app-updates/README.md).

Releases for this fork are published to `tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift`. The app's
default update feed (`AppUpdateManager.defaultRepository`) and
`Scripts/make_release_artifacts.sh` both point at that repository;
`REPOSITORY` can be overridden to publish the same artifacts to a mirror.

## Release SOP

The canonical release workflow for a new version (e.g. `0.0.10`). Follow these
steps in order. Do not skip the verification steps.

### 1. Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# Ensure working tree is clean and you are on main
git status
git branch

# Pull latest remote changes
git fetch origin
git pull origin main

# Verify the version you are about to release does not already exist
git tag -l | grep "^0\.0\.10$"
# Should print nothing. If it prints the tag, abort.
```

### 2. Build arm64 (Apple Silicon) DMG

```bash
# Clean previous build artifacts to avoid architecture contamination
make clean

# Build release DMG for arm64
make release-dmg VERSION=0.0.10
```

Outputs in `build/release/`:

- `Kumo-macos-0.0.10-arm64.dmg`
- `latest-arm64.yml`
- `latest.yml` (backward-compatible alias for arm64)

**Verify:**

```bash
ls -la build/release/
# Expect three files; note the arm64 DMG size and SHA-256 for later
```

### 3. Build amd64 (Intel) DMG

The amd64 build must not reuse the Release products directory from the arm64
build, otherwise Xcode may produce a mixed-architecture bundle.

```bash
# Remove only the Release products, keeping the arm64 DMG
rm -rf build/Build/Products/Release build/release/latest.yml

# Build release DMG for Intel
make release-dmg-amd64 VERSION=0.0.10
```

Outputs in `build/release/`:

- `Kumo-macos-0.0.10-amd64.dmg`
- `latest-amd64.yml`

The `latest.yml` alias is intentionally omitted here; it was already produced
by the arm64 build and must not be overwritten with amd64 URLs.

**Verify:**

```bash
ls -la build/release/
# Expect four files total (two DMGs + latest-arm64.yml + latest-amd64.yml)
```

### 4. Verify Architecture Isolation

Confirm each DMG contains a binary for exactly one architecture:

```bash
# Mount DMGs and inspect the binary (or use lipo on the extracted app)
# The arm64 DMG app should report: arm64
# The amd64 DMG app should report: x86_64
```

If either app reports both architectures, the build was contaminated. Start
over from `make clean`.

### 5. Create and Push Git Tag

```bash
git tag -a "0.0.10" -m "Kumo 0.0.10"
git push origin "0.0.10"
```

### 6. Create GitHub Release

Use `gh release create` with both DMGs. Write release notes covering all
commits since the previous tag.

**Requirements:**
- Release notes **must be written in English**.
- Release notes **must not contain garbled characters or escaped newlines** (`\n` appearing as literals). Use `--notes-file` instead of `--notes` to avoid shell escaping issues.

```bash
# Write release notes to a file first
cat > /tmp/release-notes.md <<'EOF'
## What's Changed

### Features
- Summarize each user-facing change.

### Bug Fixes
- Mention any bug fixes, especially user-reported issues.

### Infrastructure
- Internal refactors, dependency bumps, etc.
EOF

gh release create "0.0.10" \
  --title "Kumo 0.0.10" \
  --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md \
  --verify-tag \
  build/release/Kumo-macos-0.0.10-arm64.dmg \
  build/release/Kumo-macos-0.0.10-amd64.dmg
```

### 7. Upload Manifest Files

The DMG upload in step 6 does not include the manifest files. Upload them
separately. These are consumed by the in-app update checker.

```bash
gh release upload "0.0.10" \
  build/release/latest.yml \
  build/release/latest-amd64.yml \
  --clobber
```

**Verify:**

```bash
gh release view 0.0.10 --json assets
# Expect four assets: two DMGs + latest.yml + latest-amd64.yml
```

### 8. Verify Update URLs

```bash
# These must return 302 (redirect to the actual asset), not 404
curl -sI "https://github.com/tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift/releases/latest/download/latest.yml"
curl -sI "https://github.com/tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift/releases/latest/download/latest-amd64.yml"
```

### 9. Smoke Test In-App Update Check

Install the new DMG on a test machine (or the build machine), open the app,
navigate to **About Kumo** and click **Check for Updates**.

- Expected: "Kumo is up to date." (no error, no 404).
- If it returns HTTP 404, the manifest files were not uploaded correctly.

### 10. Update Release Notes (Optional)

If the initial release notes were minimal, edit them on the GitHub release page
with a fuller summary. The release notes are what users read; the manifest
`releaseNotes` field only needs to point back to the release page.

**Remember:** Release notes must always be in English and properly formatted
(no literal `\n` or garbled text).

## Release Channels

- Stable updates read `https://github.com/tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift/releases/latest/download/latest.yml` (arm64) or `latest-amd64.yml` (Intel).
- Beta updates read `https://github.com/tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift/releases/download/pre-release/latest.yml` (arm64) or `latest-amd64.yml` (Intel).
- Settings may override the manifest URL for development or private feeds. Leave it blank for the default GitHub Releases feed.

## Manifest Format

Kumo's updater consumes one manifest per architecture. The default stable feed
uses the Apple Silicon manifest:

- `latest.yml` — arm64 / Apple Silicon
- `latest-amd64.yml` — amd64 / Intel x86_64

Each manifest keeps the single-asset shape expected by
`AppUpdateManager`: `downloadURL`, `assetName`, and `sha256`. Do not replace
these files with a combined `assets:` list unless the app-side parser is
changed in the same release.

```yaml
version: 0.0.1
channel: stable
downloadURL: https://github.com/tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift/releases/download/0.0.1/Kumo-macos-0.0.1-arm64.dmg
assetName: Kumo-macos-0.0.1-arm64.dmg
sha256: <64-character-sha256>
releaseNotes: |
  See https://github.com/tom-cat-mao/mihomo-swift/releases/tag/0.0.1
```

The app also accepts the same fields as JSON for local testing and backwards
compatibility. See [App Updates](app-updates/README.md) for the runtime
manifest contract and automatic-install requirements.

## Building Artifacts

Use the release helper to build the Release `.app`, create the DMG, and emit
the architecture-specific manifest:

```bash
make release-dmg VERSION=0.0.1 CHANNEL=stable ARCH=arm64
make release-dmg VERSION=0.0.1 CHANNEL=stable ARCH=amd64
# shorthand for Intel: make release-dmg-amd64 VERSION=0.0.1 CHANNEL=stable
```

`VERSION` is passed through to Xcode as `MARKETING_VERSION`, so the built
`Kumo.app/Contents/Info.plist` and manifests use the same app version.
Override `BUILD_NUMBER` to set `CFBundleVersion`; it defaults to `1`.
The artifact script validates the built app version before creating the DMG.

Release builds must also include the bundled Sub-Store payload in
`KumoCoreKit` resources: Node sidecar, `sub-store.bundle.js`, and
`manifest.json`. The Sub-Store frontend is no longer bundled; Kumo's SwiftUI
UI talks to the backend directly. Kumo does not download Sub-Store at
runtime; app updates are the update channel for the bundled Sub-Store
resources. The Node sidecar is not tracked in Git; `make app-release` runs
`Scripts/prepare_substore_runtime.sh` before invoking Xcode so the generated
runtime is present in the resource bundle without committing the large binary.

The DMG is laid out as a Finder install window. `Assets/dmg-background.png`
provides the 660×420 paper background with handwritten labels and a
pencil-drawn small-loop arrow from `Kumo.app` toward the `/Applications` alias.
If Finder automation cannot address the mounted volume, the script logs a
warning and still emits a usable DMG with the default Finder layout.

### Bundled user agent

Release bundles also ship the user-tier ("kumod") payload: the shared
`KumoService` binary at `Contents/MacOS/KumoService` and the LaunchAgent plist
at `Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kumo.KumoAgent.plist`, rendered during the
build by `Scripts/prepare_agent_launchagent.sh` from
`Resources/KumoApp/LaunchAgents/io.kumo.KumoAgent.plist`. Verify the artifacts
in a release bundle before shipping:

```bash
plutil -lint "build/Build/Products/Release/Kumo.app/Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/io.kumo.KumoAgent.plist"
test -x "build/Build/Products/Release/Kumo.app/Contents/MacOS/KumoService"
```

launchd requires absolute paths, so the rendered plist embeds the build
machine's home directory and the built bundle path. At install time the app
validates the bundled plist against the current machine (the configured helper
must exist and be executable, and the `--app-support` path must match this
user); when it does not match — the app was built or installed elsewhere —
registration falls back to a generated per-user `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
plist plus `launchctl bootstrap`. See
[System Integration and Permissions](system-integration-permissions.md) for the
registration flow.

Outputs are written to `build/release/` for the selected architecture:

- `Kumo-macos-0.0.1-arm64.dmg` or `Kumo-macos-0.0.1-amd64.dmg`
- `latest.yml` for that architecture

For a dual-architecture GitHub release, collect and upload these four assets:

- `Kumo-macos-0.0.1-arm64.dmg`
- `Kumo-macos-0.0.1-amd64.dmg`
- `latest-arm64.yml` and `latest-amd64.yml` (per-architecture manifests)
- `latest.yml` (backward-compatible arm64 alias)

Upload both DMGs, `latest.yml`, and `latest-amd64.yml` to the GitHub Release.
The `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` workflow automates this collection,
validates that each manifest points at the matching architecture and tag, and
uploads all four assets. For beta, set `CHANNEL=beta`; the manifest points at
the `pre-release` tag unless `RELEASE_TAG` is explicitly provided.

## Runtime Update Flow

For runtime behavior, see [App Updates](app-updates/README.md). That document
owns the app-side polling, notification throttling, download cache, and
installer-helper details.

Automatic replacement requires the current app's parent directory to be
writable. If Kumo is in a protected location, the update flow reports a clear
error and the user can install manually from the download page.
